/*

The `main()` function in C++ is special because it serves as the program's entry point. When `main()` completes execution, it can return an integer value to the operating system. This value is often treated as the exit status of the program.

The convention is:

1. `return 0;`: This indicates that the program terminated successfully without any errors.
2. Non-zero return value: This typically indicates that the program encountered an error. The specific non-zero value can give additional information about the nature of the error.

By explicitly returning a value from `main()`, you make your intention clear to others reading your code and to the operating system. In C++, if control reaches the end of `main()` without encountering a `return` statement, `return 0;` is executed implicitly. However, explicitly adding `return 0;` is still considered good style because:

1. It makes the program's behavior clear to anyone reading the code.
2. It ensures consistent behavior across different compilers and programming languages, as not all languages or compilers may have the implicit `return 0;`.
3. It can help prevent bugs. For example, if you modify the code in the future and accidentally add statements after the intended return point but forget to add a `return` statement, the compiler will warn you.

So, while modern C++ compilers will implicitly return 0 from `main()`, it's still considered good practice to be explicit about it.
